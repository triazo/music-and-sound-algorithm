\title {Algorithms to Generate Compositions in Baroque or Classical Style}
\author {Adam Freeman & Mark Blanco}
\maketitle

For the final project, we are algorithmically generating music. So
far, we have been focusing on building a library that will allow us to
state markov chains with relative ease, and to convert them to a midi
file.  Without using any external libraries (the midi file is written
directly using the file specification and low level C++ programming),
we have abstracted over midi events to allow for relatively easy
creation of midi files. We then created a markov chain interpreter
that goes through the inputted markov chain and chooses the next node
depending on inputted probabilities, and creates a midi file.

Currently the implementation is not perfect -- the midi files have
some inconsistencies don't necessarily work on all systems (they
generally do on the system that they were created on).  After this,
the next step is to finish fixing bugs in the implementation, then onto
tailoring the Markov chain design to sound less random and more like
pleasant classical music.
