\title {Algorithms to Generate Compositions in Baroque or Classical Style}
\author {Adam Freeman & Mark Blanco}
\maketitle

Our final project will revolve around the creation of a program to
algorithmically generate music. We will use computer algorithms to
generate a piece of music, probably in the classical or baroque styles
(at least to start) and output the result to a midi file.  The initial
step in this will involve creating a harmony to an inputted melody, and
eventually to implement a melody generation algorithm as well (which
will then be fed to the harmony generating algorithm to generate a
fuller piece of music).  The project will focus on technological
composition and the sounds presented will be arbatrary, depending on
the midi sequencer used -  in initial tests, the virtual instrument
will most likely be a paino.  This project will focus on the
mathematical relationships between notes as well as the structure of
melodies, and the relationship between melody and harmony.
