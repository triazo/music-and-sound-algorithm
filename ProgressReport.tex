\maketitle
Thus far, we have written a hard-coded program that can generate a midi file that plays one quarter note. We are currently adapting the low-level bit-shifting code for use with several classes, including a midi channel event class, a meta event class, and a parent event class. In addition, we have an implementation of Markov chains through the use of a graph and vertex class.
